# Getting Started
FreakiFest is very similar to Manifest (by Google)! If you know that, you can write a FreakiFest file.
# Setting up
FreakiFest doesn't need an npm program, no nothing! Just make a F.json file.
<br>
These lines are required:
f_ver, name, soft_ver, description, and custom
<br>
An example of this is available [here](../examples/plain.json).
# How do I use FreakiFest?
That's up to you! FreakiFest is simply a way of writing JSON, not a program.
<br>
Interpret your F.json file in any way!
<br>
You could use it as a save system, like [Banana Simulator](https://github.com/Freakybob-Team-Games/Banana-Simulator) did.
<br>
Maybe a version system? It's all up to you!
# Will this work in existing places (ex: Chrome Extension Store, etc)?
No. Places must implement their own intepretation of FreakiFest.
