# Cus.Provider
This page contains information about Cus.Provider.
# Why?
We and other people, I'm sure, want to identify who makes Cus, so people can feel a sense of security and can verify that you are you.
# But I don't own a domain!
That's fine! Any domain works, even those from services like Neocities.
<br>
Example:
<br>
"Lorem.provider": "org.neocities.username"
# Where will this even be used?
It can be used anywhere, depending on what you're doing!
<br>
For example, if there were to be an extension store, it could list your Freakifest like this:
<br>
Version: 1
<br>
Cus:
<br>
com.example.heart
